19	Barking Dog	Barking Dog Studios by Glenn Barnes, Peter Grant, Michael Gyori, Christopher Mair, Brian Thalken, and Sean Thompson. They had worked at developer Radical Entertainment until the company faced financial difficulties in the late 1990s. As the studio's partnership with Disney had faltered, it lost its ESPN license and was briefly in receivership. This prompted the formation of multiple companies by employees who left Radical Entertainment, including Black Box Games. The sextet established Barking Dog in May 1998. They sought a "non-corporate, non-pretentious" name during a brainstorming session and settled on one derived from the Barking Dog, a pub in California. The company formally began operating on 16 July 1998 after signing its first publishing contract.\n\nThe nascent studio worked with developer Relic Entertainment and publisher Sierra Studios on programming for the 1999 game Homeworld, and were shortly thereafter greenlit to develop an expansion pack, Homeworld: Cataclysm. During this time, Barking Dog moved into Relic's offices and had roughly twenty employees engaged in the game's development. Cataclysm was announced in February 2000 and released in September that year. When an updated version was released via the GOG.com platform in June 2017, its name was changed to Homeworld: Emergence because Blizzard Entertainment had since registered the "Cataclysm" trademark for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.\n\nAround 1999, Valve became interested in Counter-Strike, a mod co-created by Barking Dog employee Minh Le. As it became more deeply involved in the project, the company hired Barking Dog for the mod's "Beta 5" update. The studio developed roughly 90% of that update, which was released in December 1999. Le joined Valve shortly thereafter to continue Counter-Strike's development, and the finished game was released in November 2000. In the same month, Barking Dog was rumored to be developing a tactical first-person shooter, which Crave Entertainment announced as Global Operations in December that year. Global Operations was released in March 2002, co-published by Crave Entertainment and Electronic Arts. Barking Dog began developing a proprietary game engine, ARES, in January 2001 and subsequently commenced production on a real-time strategy game using the engine that June. When the engine was unveiled in April 2002, the company expected to announce the game at that year's E3. The game, announced as Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon, was developed in tandem with Treasure Planet, the Disney film it is based on. Disney's games division, Disney Interactive, released the game in November 2002 shortly before the movie.\n\nOn 1 August 2002, Take-Two Interactive announced its acquisition of Barking Dog for US$3 million in cash and 242,450 shares of restricted common stock, an estimated $9 million total value. As part of the purchase, Barking Dog became part of Take-Two's Rockstar Games label as Rockstar Vancouver. Rockstar Canada, Rockstar Games's studio in Oakville, Ontario, was renamed Rockstar Toronto to avoid confusion between the two.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_1080p/vrapmoo1uyd4mnsxjcwv.jpg	1998-01-01 07:00:00+00	barking-dog

272	Atari Interactive	Atari Interactive, Inc. (formerly known as Infogrames Interactive, Inc. and Hasbro Interactive, Inc.) is an American subsidiary of Atari SA, formerly known as Infogrames Entertainment SA. The company was originally founded by toy company Hasbro in 1995 as Hasbro Interactive, and was sold to Infogrames at the beginning of 2001.\n\nHasbro Interactive was formed late in 1995 to allow Hasbro to enter the video game market. Several Hasbro properties, such as Monopoly and Scrabble, had already been made into successful video games by licensees such as Virgin Interactive. With Hasbro's game experience, video games seemed like a natural extension of the company and a good opportunity for revenue growth. Hasbro Interactive's objective was to develop and publish games based on Hasbro properties.\n\nIn January 1997, the company announced they would publish games for the PlayStation.\n\nBy the middle of 2000, the dot-com bubble had burst, Hasbro share price had lost 70% of its value in just over a year and Hasbro would post a net loss for the first time in two decades.\n\nFaced with these difficulties, on December 6, 2000, Hasbro announced they would completely sell off their Hasbro Interactive division to French software company Infogrames.\n\nThe sale included nearly all of their video game related rights and properties, the Atari brand and Hasbro's Games.com division, developer MicroProse and all of its software titles up to that point except for the Avalon Hill property. Hasbro Interactive's sale price was $100 million, $95 million as 4.5 million common shares of Infogrames and $5 million in cash. Under the terms of the sale agreement, Infogrames gained the rights to develop games based on Hasbro properties for a period of 15 years plus an option for an additional 5 years based on performance.[14] The deal was completed on January 29, 2001. Majesco had ended its relationship with Hasbro once Infogrames took over the gaming company.\n\nFollowing the purchase of the company, Infogrames renamed the company to Infogrames Interactive, Inc., alongside rebranding many of their subsidiaries under the name as well.\n\nIn May 2003, with Infogrames planning to rebrand all their subsidiaries under the Atari brand name, the existing Atari Interactive, Inc. subsidiary was merged with Infogrames Interactive, Inc. and gained the Atari Interactive, Inc. name, being a wholly owned subsidiary of Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). At the same time, the Infogrames, Inc. subsidiary licensed the Atari name and logo from Atari Interactive and changed its name to Atari, Inc. using it to develop, publish and distribute games for all major video game consoles and personal computers under the Atari brand. Atari SA still maintains ownership of the original Atari properties received through Hasbro which are kept in their Hasbro Interactive originated placeholder, Atari Interactive, Inc.\n\nOn June 9, 2005, Hasbro bought back the digital gaming rights for their properties from IESA for $65 million. Within the deal, Hasbro purchased back the video game rights to Transformers, My Little Pony, Tonka, Magic: The Gathering, Connect Four, Candy Land and Playskool, while obtaining a 10-year exclusive deal to produce video games based on Monopoly, Scrabble, Game of Life, Battleship, Clue, Yahtzee, Simon, Risk and Boggle, alongside an expanded separate deal with the Dungeons & Dragons franchise. This ten-year deal excluding D&D was soon shortened, as on August 10, 2007, Hasbro announced they had signed a new casual game deal with Electronic Arts.\n\nOn January 21, 2013, Atari, Inc. and Atari Interactive, Inc. (collectively, the "Companies") filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. All three Ataris emerged from bankruptcy one year later and the entering of the social casino gaming industry with Atari Casino.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_1080p/fez1uitcra6cezyfajbs.jpg	1998-01-01 07:00:00+00	atari-interactive

341	MumboJumbo	The company was founded in January 2001 by Mark Dochtermann and Ron Dimant after leaving Ritual Entertainment. In 2003 it became one of the first independent developers to popularize casual games by partnering with portal sites to make games available for download directly to Windows and Mac computers.\n\nMumboJumbo was previously a United Developers Company that acquired other development companies including Zono, Ritual Entertainment, and Hot Lava Studios.\n\nOn January 24, 2007, MumboJumbo announced their acquisition of Ritual Entertainment, a popular developer of first person shooter titles such as SiN and Star Trek: Elite Force II. Upon acquisition Ritual was made to assist with work on casual game titles, causing many prominent employees to leave the company and many analysts to speculate why the acquisition had been made in the first place. Some analysts have since criticized the move as both foolish and a massive waste of money. It is still unclear as to the purpose of MumboJumbo's decision, as MumboJumbo had not released an official statement regarding their intentions to acquire a game developer known for creating mature titles in order to re-purpose them for casual game development.\n\nOn January 25, 2010, a jury in the 193rd Civil District Court in Dallas County, Texas awarded MumboJumbo $4,600,000 in damages resulting from a breach of contract on the part of their former business partner PopCap Games. MumboJumbo had previously held a North American retail distribution agreement with the casual games developer. According to MumboJumbo, the relationship was violated when PopCap Games began to develop its own strategies for selling at retail. During the 12-day trial, MumboJumbo's law firm Rose-Walker showed that PopCap's actions "severely damaged" their business relationship with Walmart.\n\nAs of late 2017, operations seem to have ceased, their website only leads to a logo without any of the content they used to host.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_1080p/cl9z3.jpg	2001-01-01 07:00:00+00	mumbojumbo

355	Technos Japan	Technōs Japan Corp. was a Japanese video game developer, best known for the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun (which includes Renegade, Super Dodge Ball and River City Ransom) franchises. As of June 2015, Arc System Works owns the intellectual properties of Technōs Japan.\n\nInitially operating from a single-room apartment, Technōs was founded in 1981 by three staff members of Data East. Their first game was Minky Monkey, released in 1982. A few months after their foundation, a lawsuit was brought up against the company by Data East under allegations that Technos had stolen data from Data East's arcade game Pro Tennis with the intent of producing and selling a bootleg of it.[3] The two companies settled in August 1983 and Technos would go on to create two arcade games published by Data East, Tag Team Wrestling and Karate Champ. Technōs Japan's earlier games were published by other companies, as Technōs at the time did not have the economical resource to distribute their own games.\n\nNekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun ("Hot Blooded Tough Guy Kunio"), a side-scrolling beat-em-up released in 1986 about a high school student who fought thugs and delinquents from other schools, was the company's first big hit in Japan. Kunio-kun was released in the west as Renegade with the game's graphics changed to make the game marketable in the overseas market. Technōs would then produce a Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game, which would be Technōs' first game for the home console market. Technōs Japan's subsequent arcade beat-em-up, Double Dragon, was a big success worldwide when it was released in 1987, leading to the production of an NES version of the game, as well as licensed versions by other companies for various platforms.\n\nThe success of Kunio-kun led to the production of numerous spin-offs and sequels starring the same character produced for the 8-bit Family Computer platform in Japan and later for the Game Boy and Super Famicom, resulting in more than twenty games starring Kunio by the mid-1990s, many of which were rule-bending sports games. A few Kunio-kun games were localized for the North American market; namely Super Dodge Ball, River City Ransom (considered by critics to be a cult classic[citation needed]) and Nintendo World Cup, but none maintain any connection with each other. Technōs would attempt to remedy this by attempting to localize several Kunio-kun under the Crash 'n the Boys label, but only Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge was released (the game's ending features a teaser for Ice Challenge, which was unreleased).\n\nTechnōs also released two arcade sequels to Double Dragon: Double Dragon II: The Revenge in 1988 and Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone in 1990 (the latter was developed by an external development team at East Technology), and produced the respective NES versions of those games, as well as Super Double Dragon in 1992, an original installment for the Super NES. An American-produced Double Dragon animated series and a live-action film were also made as well.\n\nOutside the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun games, Technōs produced a few original games for the arcade and home markets such as U.S. Championship V'Ball, The Combatribes and Shadow Force, as well as two WWF arcade games (WWF Superstars and WWF Wrestlefest), but most of these games did not achieve the same kind of success that Kunio-kun and Double Dragon achieved. The company's last games were produced for the Neo Geo hardware, which include a Double Dragon fighting game based on the movie, their second and last fighting game Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, and a Neo-Geo sequel to Super Dodge Ball. By 1996, Technōs Japan declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Some of the developers who worked on the Neo Geo titles (including Kengo Asai) briefly worked at Face, a former affiliate of SNK.\n\nFollowing the closure, a licensing company named Million Co., Ltd was formed to purchase the former intellectual properties of Technōs Japan. Million continued to produce new games such as Super Dodge Ball Advance, Double Dragon Advance and River City Ransom EX for the Game Boy Advance, Super Dodgeball Brawlers for the Nintendo DS, as well as reissuing older titles via the Virtual Console and other services. On June 11, 2015, Arc System Works announced they had acquired all intellectual properties of Technōs Japan from Million Co., Ltd.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_1080p/cl8bk.jpg	1981-01-01 07:00:00+00	technos-japan
356	Hulabee Entertainment Inc.	Hulabee Entertainment was a game company founded in July 2001 by Shelley Day and Ron Gilbert, both previously the founders of Humongous Entertainment. The company struck a deal with Disney Interactive, who published their games through the Plaid Banana Entertainment imprint.\n\nThe company stopped releasing new titles in 2004 and closed the next year, due to co-founder Shelley Day being convicted for fraud. In March 2002, Day requested loans, claiming she was selling part of Hulabee to Disney Interactive and showing a fake "letter of intent" for the sale. When she stopped paying, Day stated the sale was delayed due to Disney Interactive being sold to Vivendi Universal Games, again providing false documents to "prove" it. In 2003, a lawyer representing the bank contacted Disney Interactive in regards to their alleged sale to Vivendi Universal, and they both found out that Day had actually used the loans to buy a $3 million dream house in Mercer Island, Washington. This ultimately led to Day being imprisoned for 30 months on charges for bank fraud, and thus the folding of Hulabee in the process.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_1080p/clb62.jpg	2001-01-01 07:00:00+00	hulabee-entertainment-inc

They were also responsible for the creation of various development hardware both first and 3rd party developers would use to make games for Nintendo systems, such as the IS Nitro Emulator, the official development kit for the Nintendo DS.\n\nIntelligent Systems started when programmer Toru Narihiro was hired by Nintendo to port Famicom Disk System software to the standard ROM-cartridge format that was being used outside Japan on the NES. Similarly to the origins of HAL Laboratory, the team soon became an auxiliary program unit for Nintendo that provided system tools and hired people to program, fix, or port Nintendo-developed software. Much of the team's original work consists of minor contributions to larger games developed by Nintendo R&D1 and Nintendo EAD.\n\nNarihiro programmed his first video games, Famicom Wars and Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, towards the end of the Famicom's life cycle, although the game design, graphic design, and music was provided by the Nintendo R&D1 team. Because of Narihiro's success, Intelligent Systems began to hire graphic designers, programmers, and musicians to extend the company from an auxiliary–tool developer to a game development group. The company continued to develop new entries in the Wars and Fire Emblem franchises.\n\nIn 2000, Intelligent Systems produced Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64, which became a surprise hit, leading to five sequels. Three years later, the first entry in the WarioWare series was released on the Game Boy Advance, and it too became a successful series.\n\nNot all games developed by Intelligent Systems are published by Nintendo. Cubivore: Survival of the Fittest (which was co-developed by Intelligent Systems) was published by Atlus in North America; Intelligent Systems also developed various Dragon Quest games, which were published by Square Enix.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_1080p/cl8by.jpg	1986-01-01 07:00:00+00	intelligent-systems

The odd event is not shared by them alone however: occurrences of the newly dead re-awakening and disturbing the populace are being reported all over the city, prompting the Archchancellor of Unseen University to halt his usual activities of feasting and merrymaking, and to take charge of the situation. Much to Rincewind's despair, the entirety of this process involves appointing him to the task of finding Death and convincing him to resume his work.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pxe.jpg	1996-11-30 00:00:00+00	T	8292
629	TOCA World Touring Cars	TOCA World Touring Cars (Called Jarrett & Labonte Stock Car Racing in the USA and WTC: World Touring Car Championship in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters, and released for PlayStation in 2000, and for Game Boy Advance only in Europe in 2003. It is part of the TOCA Touring Car series.\n\nIt features various Touring Car championships from around the world, but despite carrying the TOCA name, a fully licensed British Touring Car Championship (ToCa) series was not included. This upset a lot of fans of the series, but success continued.

The campaign follows Arkantos, an Atlantean admiral embarking on a journey through the lands of the game's three cultures, hunting for a cyclops who is in league with Poseidon against Atlantis.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2xlp.jpg	2002-10-30 00:00:00+00	T	324
678	Ostriv	Ostriv is a city-building game that puts you in a role of a governor of an 18th century Ukrainian town to challenge your creative skills and management abilities. \n \nOstriv aims to raise the bar of city-building experience by adding a huge amount of possibilities and removing annoying limitations. It allows for truly organic town layouts without the grid and angle restrictions on a three-dimensional landscape. The goal is to make player's creations to become alive and believable communities where real-life problems would arise, thus making the late game a new challenge rather than a repetitive chore.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20pt.jpg	2020-03-19 00:00:00+00	NaN	24512

683	Project Justice	Project Justice is the sequel to Rival Schools: United By Fate.\n\nProject Justice's fighting system is lifted from the original Rival Schools, with some notable changes. The game continues to be a team fighter, but has teams of three characters instead of two. This allows another Team-Up attack to be used in a fight, but also adds a new type of attack, the Party-Up, initiated by pressing any three attack buttons. The Party-Up is a three-person attack that varies based on what school the character initiating the attack is from.\n\nThe additional partner also allows players to cancel an opponent's Team-Up Special by inputting a Team-Up command of their own. This initiates a short fighting sequence between one character from each team. If the person initiating the sequence gets the first successful hit in during the sequence before time runs out, the Team-Up they are caught in will be canceled, and the game switches back to the main fight; if the opposing player gets the first hit or time runs out, the Team-Up continues as usual.\n\nAdditionally, the 'vigor' meter in Project Justice is limited to 5 levels (down from 9 in Rival Schools), with Party-Ups requiring all 5 levels, Team-Ups continuing to cost two levels, and any attempts (successful or not) to cancel a Team-Up costing one level.\n\nAlso carrying over from the first game, the Dreamcast port of Project Justice in Japan includes a character creation mode that allows a player to create their own fighters who can be used in all modes except for single-player. However, the character creation in Project Justice is packaged as a board game, taking place during an inter-school festival, rather than a date sim game like in Rival Schools. As with School Life Mode in the original Rival Schools, though, this boardgame is not included in non-Japanese ports of Project Justice due to the amount of time it would take to translate the mode. Instead, several unlockable sub-characters were included in these ports, built from the character creation parts in the Japanese version.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co8iy0.jpg	2000-12-17 00:00:00+00	T	13096

684	Doom	Doom Classic is a sci-fi first-person shooter game developed by id Software and Nerve Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is an updated version of the original 1993 Doom that uses the Unity engine as a shell for the id Tech 1 engine.\n\nThis game, as well as Doom II Classic, was initially released in a suite of classic Doom ports for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android, however, the ports were initially heavily criticized due to its poor quality and inaccuracies compared to the previous console generation ports while implementing an always-online DRM that required the player to sign into a Bethesda.net account (meant to unlock Slayers Club rewards) to play the game, despite these ports not having any online multiplayer features.\n\nAfter the initial criticism of the ports, Nerve Software eventually rectified the issues of the log-in requirements and problems with the ports through patches. A PC version of Doom Classic was released through Bethesda.net on January 9, 2020, which was later re-released through Steam on September 3, 2020 as a free update to existing owners of The Ultimate Doom.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3m5h.jpg	2019-07-26 00:00:00+00	M	165206

The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, all while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co20gb.jpg	1998-12-21 00:00:00+00	T	5
718	Galaga '88	The gameplay in Galaga '88 is built on the same premise as that of the original Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).\n\nWith the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and each begins with the on-screen announcement "That's Galactic Dancin'!" and has its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen. However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a Challenging Stage awards a "secret bonus" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000 points, and equal to the "special bonus" which would have been awarded for destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.\n\nGalaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy, while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation. Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the first one on each stage will leave a "Warp Capsule".\n\nAt the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27, the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the "continue" option to "on", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2pol.jpg	1987-12-01 00:00:00+00	E	15535

722	Quest for Glory II: Trial by Fire	Trial by Fire is the sequel to Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero. It takes place in the town Shapeir and the desert surrounding it, in a Middle East-like environment. It seems that the powerful elemental spirits have been troubling the Shapeir folk recently.

It is the hero's task to find out what is going on, get acquainted with the many inhabitants of Shapeir, and prove once more that he is worthy of his heroic title.\n\nLike its predecessor, Trial by Fire is a hybrid game that incorporates elements from adventure and role-playing genres. It has a text-based interface, puzzles to solve, inventory items, characters to talk to, as well as pure RPG elements such as character growth system and battles. Player character can be either a fighter, a thief, or a wizard, and can also become a paladin during the course of the game if he follows a strict moral code.\n\nReal-time combat is presented on separate screens and offers more options than the previous title. There are several types of high, mid-level, and low attacks, as well as parrying and dodging. The hero raises his combat proficiency and other skills by fighting enemies, training, and performing various actions that influence the corresponding parameters.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25et.jpg	1990-12-31 00:00:00+00	M	1894

Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.\n\nThe game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes.

Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions, and the character's turn is able to continue. The order of the turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed. Units can use offensive actions, such as physical attacks or offensive magic, only on units belonging to the other side and can use supportive actions, such as healing magic, stat-enhancing magic, and items, only on units belonging to the same side.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6o6u.jpg	1992-03-20 00:00:00+00	E	3041

While the initial idea of the developers was to make just n HD remastered release, it ended up being more of a re-created game version. As such, the game offers both classic mode as well as refined mode with all new elements and new gameplay.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co25uq.jpg	2016-01-14 00:00:00+00	T	15709
871	Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King	Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is the eighth installment in the Dragon Quest series, developed by Level-5 and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It was also later released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2015.\n\nIt is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional first-person view.\n\nLike in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co7vf2.jpg	2004-11-27 00:00:00+00	T	1819

859	Professor Layton and the Unwound Future	As with previous Professor Layton games, Unwound Future is an adventure game where the player solves puzzles offered by local citizens to progress the story forward, through dialogue and around 32 minutes of full motion video. The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a "super hint", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of "Picarats", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1wtg.jpg	2008-11-27 00:00:00+00	E10	1399

943	God of War: Ghost of Sparta	"Marking Kratos' second foray into portable gaming, God of War: Ghost of Sparta stands as a spin-off nestled between the events of God of War and God of War II. Despite ascending to the title of the god of war, Kratos remains haunted by nightmarish visions. One such vision compels him to embark on a new journey when he witnesses his mother, Callisto, imprisoned in Atlantis under the dominion of the sea god Poseidon. Against Athena's counsel to ignore the vision, Kratos sets forth to unravel his past and, in the process, rescue his long-lost brother, Deimos, from the clutches of the god of death, Thanatos.\n\nThis second instalment for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) maintains a gameplay style akin to its predecessor, introducing a handful of new mechanics. Kratos wields his trusty Blades of Athena in this quest, now augmented with a new magic known as Thera's Bane, amplifying the potency of his attacks. The game also introduces several new magical items and a fresh secondary weapon. In addition to the captivating story mode, Ghost of Sparta offers the "Temple of Zeus," a location where players can spend orbs acquired in the Battle Arena to acquire various art and other bonuses."	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co3dio.jpg	2010-11-02 00:00:00+00	M	550

Tolkien’s Middle-earth that has been continuously running, enhanced, and remastered since fall of 1991.

The action takes place nearly 100 years prior to The Hobbit but long after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just been found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place.\n\nMUME covers 28,000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of the Lhûn in the West to the Mountains of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost Erain in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South.\n\nPlayers can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics.

Moreover, the orkish tribe of the Zaugurz is trying to expand its territory at the expense of the Tarkhnarb Orcs of Goblin Gate. Most of this conflict takes place to the east and south of the town of Bree, but rare raids or solitary agents of the Red Eye have made it to as far west as the Dwarven homes in the Blue Mountains.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co2f30.jpg	1992-12-31 00:00:00+00	NaN	136790

1079	Elasto Mania	Elasto Mania (also known as Elma) is a physics-simulation game released in 2000. It claims to be "based on a real physical model." It explores the notion of elastic motorcycles. The goal of each level is to collect every apple (disappearing by contact) spread throughout it, and then to touch the flower (the exit object). Some people, especially the ones part of online groups such as Mopolauta, play the game trying to finish levels as fast as possible, while others, mostly quite-new-to-the-game players, simply concern themselves with the accomplishment of levels, often first requiring figuring out a way for them to be solved. Ultimately, though, experienced players are motivated by the objective of finishing levels in the least amount of time possible, trying either to settle down personal, or world, records. That contributes to setting the stage for serious competition, especially in the official game levels.	//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co27s6.jpg	2000-02-01 00:00:00+00	NaN	9103
